# Build an Executable:
# This example was taken from apps/qbman_speed.
# This makefile says that:
#   1. It will generate an executable "qbman_speed uses" (bin_PROGRAMS).
#   2. It will add an include dir to the build include path (my_CFLAGS).
#   3. It will compile 3 source files (qbman_speed_SOURCES).
#   4. It will link 4 of our libs (qbman_speed_LDADD).
#   5. It will link 1 external lib (qbman_speed_sys_LDADD).
# After compilation, the executable will be in the TOP_LEVEL/bin_powerpc/
# directory.

# Build a library.
# This example was taken from drivers/bman.
# This makefile says that:
#   1. It will generate an archive with the basename "usdpaa_bman"
#   (lib_LIBRARIES).
#   2. It will compile 2 source files (usdpaa_bman_SOURCES).
# After compilation, the executable will be in TOP_LEVEL/lib_powerpc.
